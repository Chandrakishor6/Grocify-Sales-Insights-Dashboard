# 🛒 Grocify Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project

This is an end-to-end data analytics project presents a comprehensive analytics report for **Grocify**, a leading quick-commerce grocery delivery platform. The core objective was to evaluate the company's sales performance, customer satisfaction, inventory attributes, and outlet-based segmentation using SQL and Power BI.
The analysis focusses on identifying actionable KPIs and uncovering optimization opportunities across outlets, products, and customer interactions to guide future business strategy.

## 🧾 KPIs

After carefully analyzing the business requirements and objectives shared by stakeholders, I translated those needs into measurable KPIs that would provide clear insights and support decision-making.

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Total Sales** | Measures total revenue generated from item sales across all outlets |
| **Average Sales** | Captures mean sales value to identify purchasing patterns |

| **Average Customer Rating** | Serves as a proxy for customer satisfaction and product quality |

## 📈 Analysis Summary

To better understand what's driving sales and uncover actionable insights to support strategic decision-making, I analyzed the data from multiple angles. The goal was to see how fat content, item type, and outlet characteristis (establisment year, location and size ) affects the KPIs. Following are the area of analysis:

1. **Sales by Fat Content:** Analyzed the impact of fat content on total sales. Also assessed how other KPIs vary with fat content
2. **sales by Item Type:** Identified the performance of different item type in terms of total sales and other KPIs
3. **Fat Content by Outlet for total sales:** Compared the total sales accross different outlets, segmented by fat content. Also assessed the affect of different outlet on other KPIs
4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year:** Evaluated how outlet establishment year had influenced the total sales.
5. **Sales by Outlet Size and Location:** Analyzed the corelation between sales and outlet size and its location.
6. **All Metrics by Outlet Type:** Provided comprensive views of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Item Sold, and Average Rating) broken down by different outlet type.
